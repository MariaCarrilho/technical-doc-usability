            Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked
            "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go
            through an extended process.

            When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an
            action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow

            Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully
            prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate
            error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a
            confirmation option before they commit to the action.

            There are two types of errors: slips and mistakes. Slips are

            Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or
